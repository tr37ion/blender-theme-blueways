# Blender Theme Blueways

This is the Blender UI theme **Blueways**.

![][snip]
The font shown in the screenshot is: *Roboto Medium*. Nowadays, I would recommmend *Fira Sans Medium* (Mozilla) as it is compact and better readable with a small font size. 

## Installation

1. get the **blueways.xml** file from above or

 git clone https://github.com/tr37ion/blender-theme-blueways.git

2. Open Blender *User Settings* with **Ctrl+Alt+U**
3. Press the **Install Theme** button down below and select **Blueways.xml** file
